## How to play
- Press `space` to start the game.
- Use the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right. 
- Destroy the bricks.

## Notes
You will need a cobol compiler like [GNU cobc](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) to build the code. I am by far not a cobol expert, so if anything does wrong you are on your own.

## Quick start
```console
$ ./build.sh
$ ./brickbreak
```
